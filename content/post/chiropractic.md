There was a [report](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9243865-region-of-waterloo-pilot-project-connects-people-on-ontario-works-with-chiropractic-care/) in the *Waterloo Region Record* recently that caught my eye. The province and the Region of Waterloo have partnered to launch a pilot project offering access to chiropractic care for Ontario Works recipients. 

Needless to say, this is apalling, even if this is only a three-year pilot project. 

On the surface of it, it seems like the idea is to help get OW recipients back to work because they often suffer back pain.  I guess. 

More likely this is a move by the Ontario Chiropractic Association to try to find a new market for their quackery. The chiropractic movement has been heavily criticized for adopting aggressive marketing strategies. Chiropractics have [recently](https://nationalpost.com/health/pediatricians-alarmed-by-chiropractic-treatments-for-babies-that-border-on-the-fraudulent) moved into the field of pediatric care. Chiropractics often [emphasize](https://www.chiropractic.on.ca/public/what-is-chiropractic-2/chiropractic-coverage/extended-health-care/) the access to their services that they can get from their workplace benefits. And lastly, let's not forget that the Ontario Chiropractic Association is heavily [dominated](https://nationalpost.com/news/college-of-chiropractors-of-ontario-anti-vaccine) by explicit anti-vaxxers and fraudsters who are [selling](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-chiropractors-at-a-crossroads-the-fight-for-evidence-based-treatment/) their treatments as effective against everything from autism to lupus. 

It seems to me to be more than a little grotesque to be offering people who having the toughest time possible a trip to a quack. And lest it be forgotten, chiropractic is pure unadulterated quackery:
