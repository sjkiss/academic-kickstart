The bulk of my research since arriving at Wilfrid Laurier University has been to investigate the politics of risk perception, particularly in regards to environmental issues.  I have completed a project on the politics of the controversial chemical BPA. In one [paper](/publication/legislation-by-agenda-setting), I was able to show that the level of news coverage in state's daily newspaper about BPA was correlated with the probability that that state would adopt a ban on BPA. In short, politicians adopt policies responding to media pressure.  In a second, more qualitative [paper](/publication/bpa-canada), I examined the interaction between legislative provisions, short term interest-group pressure and media attention that led to Canada being the first country in the world to prohibit baby bottles made with BPA. 

In the course of this project I was inspired by the work emerging on the [cultural cognition](http://culturalcognition.net) of risk perception and the cultural theory of risk. I was awarded a [SSHRC](http://www.sshrc.ca) Insight Development Grant in 2013 to develop survey measures of the core concepts of cultural theory for the canadian context. Working with [Dr. Eric Montpetit](http://www.ericmontpetit.ca/) and [Dr. Erick Lachapelle](http://www.ericklachapelle.ca), I conducted intense qualitative research and survey development to produce these measures.  Our first publicadtion from this project can be seen [here](/publication/montpetit-lachapelle-kiss).

Building on this project, I have been invited to take part in the [@risk](https://issp.uottawa.ca/en/research-and-publications/at-risk) research project, a SSHRC-funded research project that seeks to find ways to mange the democratic and technocratic tensions managing risks in contemporary Canada.
