abstract: "Cultural Theory (CT) has been widely used to explain variations in risk perception but has rarely been tested in Canada.This contribution represents the most thorough attempt to adapt Cultural Theory to the Canadian context. Results suggest that respondents’ commitment to egalitarianism is strongly correlated with risks from technology while respondents’ commitment to hierarchism was strongly correlated with risks from criminal or unsafe behaviours. Respondents’ commitments to individualism was also correlated with risks from deviant behaviours, but differed from hierarchism in that individualism was not correlated with risk perceptions from prostitution and marijuana use. Respondents’ commitments to fatalism were strongly correlated with the risk perception of vaccines. These conclusions are reinforced by results from a survey question that tests the extent to which such cultural predispositions map onto the myths of nature hypothesized by cultural theory, and by a survey experiment that tests how cultural commitments predict perceived risks from a controversial pipeline."
