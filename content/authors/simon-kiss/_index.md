I am a political scientist at [Wilfrid Laurier University](http://www.wlu.ca) in Brantford, Canada. My primary interests are in the fields of political communication, public opinion and political parties. I am originally from Edmonton, Alberta, and did my undergraduate degree in Political Science at the [University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca). After some time in Germany, including a fascinating internship at the [German Bundestag](http://www.bundestag.de/en), the [Canadian embassy](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/germany-allemagne/index.aspx?lang=eng) and a leading national [television political talk show,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Christiansen_(TV_program)) I returned to Kingston, Ontario to do my graduate work. I obtained my PhD from [Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca) in 2008 and then moved back to Germany to do my post-doctoral work at the [John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies](https://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html).
